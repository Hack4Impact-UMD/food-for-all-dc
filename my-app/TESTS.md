This project uses Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework, to make sure our code works as expected. Jest lets us write tests that automatically check if different parts of our app behave correctly, so we can catch bugs early and keep our code reliable. Each test describes a specific feature or function, and Jest runs all these tests every time we make changes. This helps us know right away if something breaks. If you've never used Jest before, don't worryâ€”each test is written in plain English and checks things like "does this button show up?" or "does this page load correctly?". By reading the test list below, you can see exactly what parts of the app are being checked and learn how automated testing helps keep our project stable and easy to improve.
