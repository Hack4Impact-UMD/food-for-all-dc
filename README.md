# food-for-all-dc

Food for All DC currently relies on a custom-built client database and scheduling application that was developed in PHP and MySQL and runs on a hosted Linux platform. This application, which includes basic mapping capabilities through Google Maps, has become outdated and is experiencing technical issues with hosting and frequent API failures.

We are tasked with modernizing and consolidating these applications into a single, user-friendly solution. The new system will manage client data in real-time, optimize delivery routes based on driver availability and geographic location, and streamline the scheduling process.
